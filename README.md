# rangedweapons-1
a mod that adds ranged weapons to minetest.

## What's changed

* This repo is forked from [daviddoesminetest/rangedweapons](https://github.com/daviddoesminetest/rangedweapons)
* Unpacked the ZIPs so you just select the release you want to have. (Quick deployment)
* Just `git pull` to update if you are on the main branch to automatically update. (Use `git status` to check for updates)
* Added dev branch for developmental states. (Most likely this branch will not even work, but it's a work in progress)
